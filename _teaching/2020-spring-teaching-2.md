The course discusses about the design and structure of computer operating systems. It covers the concepts, principles, functionality, trade-offs, and implementation of systems that support concurrent processing. The individual components of an operating system (Xinu) will be examined in detail at the source code level, and students will be expected to complete various assignments on real hardware (Raspberry Pi 2B or 3B or Beagle Bone Black or Intel Galileo board. Others are NOT recommended.). At a minimum, you will need a board, a memory card, a USB-micro cable, and a USB-serial adapter. Some of these assignments will involve simple “follow the steps” activities, while others will require the design of new or modified system components and application programs. Lectures will closely follow the expected readings which are indicated in the class schedule on the class web pages.

## Prequisites:	
This course assumes students have a good understanding of basic operating system principles similar to that provided by a traditional introductory undergraduate operating systems course. In particular, the major functions of an operating system should be familiar, as should the basic algorithms and techniques used to implement them. Concepts of concurrent programming, including processes, threads, and various mechanisms for interprocess communication should be familiar. It is expected that students will have familiarity with the API for a traditional UNIX/Linux operating system, including such things as input/output and process management. All of the programming for the course will be done using the C programming language. Familiarity with the concepts of assembly language for some machine is expected, although it is unlikely that any assembly language code will need to be written for the programming assignments.

## Grading

### Grading Type
 Letter grades will be determined using the weighted average of the various items used to evaluate students. A typical grade mapping is illustrated below.

|Points	   | Grade |
|:---------|:------|
|97 – 100% | A+    |
|93 – 96%  | A     |
|90 – 92%  | A-    |
|87 – 89%  | B+    |
|83 – 86%  | B     |
|80 – 82%  | B-    |
|77 – 79%  | C+    |
|73 – 76%  | C     |
|70 – 72%  | C-    |
|67 – 69%  | D+    |
|63 – 66%  | D     |
|60 – 62%  | D-    |
|0 – 59%   | F     |

## Late Policy
Homeworks and Programming Assignments are subject to late penalty. Here is the point deduction policy: <span style="color:red"> **20% deduction (late by 1 day), 40% deduction (late by 2days), 80% deduction (late by 3 days), and no credit if late by more than three days.** </span>

Contact the instructor in case of medical emergency, and a written proof from your doctor is required.

## Academic Integrity
You may discuss the homeworks and assignments with anyone and use any reference materials, but provided you do not copy any other person's work. We will follow the University Policy on Academic Integrity regarding any cheating and plagiarism. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the contents of this page, as you are responsible for its contents.
