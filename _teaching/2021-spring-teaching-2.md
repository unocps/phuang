This course will cover the fundamentals of robotics and application of artificial intelligence techniques to robotics. Topics include, but not limited to, probabilistic inference, learning theory, modeling development, perception, planning, and search algorithms, localization, tracking and basic control, and  programming the robotic system. These techniques will be simulated in a programming infrastructure, the Robot Operating System (ROS), which enables efficient integration of independently developed subsystems into a single system, enabling autonomous robot operation. ROS offers an environment for developing modular control software, a communication infrastructure to connect the software components and an open source library of implemented algorithms. In the scope of this course, we shall cover the practical development of software modules in the ROS environment and integrate the techniques in artificial intelligence into a completely functional system for robot control.

## Prerequisites:    
CSCI 3320 Data Structures AND any course equivalent to this course. CSCI 4500 Operating Systems AND any course equivalent to this course. CSCI 4450 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence AND any course equivalent to this course. Basic Python or C++ programming knowledge are recommended. You can take these courses in the same semester. However, if you have not taken these courses before or any concern, you will need to contact the instructor of the course for approval. 

## Suggested preparatory courses:
Math/STAT 4450/8456 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining; Knowledge of Python and C++, and familiar with Linux operating system , and GitHub for version control.

## Recommended Textbooks
* [Robot Operating System (ROS) website](http://wiki.ros.org/)
* Joseph, L. (2018). Learning Robotics using Python: Design, simulate, program, and prototype an autonomous mobile robot using ROS, OpenCV, PCL, and Python. Packt Publishing Ltd. 
This will be used as a reference, rather than as a textbook, but we will use quite a few methods from it, and it is a valuable addition to your professional library.

## Grading
There will be 3 programming assignments, one group project. 
The final course grade will be computed as follows:
* Programming Assignments: 50%
* Group Project: 20%
* Group Report and Presentation: 30%
* Canvas Discussion/Class Participation: ~5%

If you have questions regarding the grading of programming assignments, group project and report and presentation, you MUST email or come to see the instructor WITHIN ONE WEEK after the date your assignments have been returned to you.

### Grading Type
Letter grades will be determined using the weighted average of the various items used to evaluate students. A typical grade mapping is illustrated below.

|Points            | Grade |
|:-----------------|:----------|
|97 – 100%| A+    |
|93 – 96%  | A                 |
|90 – 92%  | A-    |
|87 – 89%  | B+    |
|83 – 86%  | B                 |
|80 – 82%  | B-    |
|77 – 79%  | C+    |
|73 – 76%  | C     |
|70 – 72%  | C-    |
|67 – 69%  | D+    |
|63 – 66%  | D     |
|60 – 62%  | D-    |
|0 – 59%    | F                 |

### Late Policy
Programming Assignments and Projects are subject to late penalty. Here is the point deduction policy: <span style="color:red"> **20% deduction (late by 1 day), 40% deduction (late by 2days), 80% deduction (late by 3 days), and no credit if late by more than three days.** </span>

Contact the instructor in case of medical emergency, and a written proof from your doctor is required. <span style="color:red"> **You are allowed to extend one more day after the approval.** </span>
