## Prequisites:	
CSCI 3710 (Introduction to Digital Design and Computer Organization), CSCI 3320 (Data Structures), and MATH 1950 (Calculus I). CSCI 4350 (Computer Architecture) is recommended; open only to students in the School of Engineering and declared Computer Science minors.

## Recommended Textbook
Operating System Concepts 9th Edition, by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne.

## Grading
There will be four homeworks, three programming assignments, one midterm and one final.
The final course grade will be computed as follows:

Homework: 15%
Programming Assignments: 32%
Midterm: 20%
Final 33%

If you have questions regarding the grading of homework, programming assignments, midterms and final, you MUST come to see the instructor WITHIN ONE WEEK after the date your homework, programming assignments, or exams have been returned to you.

## Late Policy
Homeworks and Programming Assignments are subject to late penalty. Here is the point deduction policy: 20% deduction (late by 1 day), 40% deduction (late by 2days), 80% deduction (late by 3 days), and no credit if late by more than three days. 

Contact the instructor in case of medical emergency, and a written proof from your doctor is required.
