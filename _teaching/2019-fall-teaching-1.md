CSCI4500 Operating Systems (Spring 2019)
============

Course Description Information
=======
* Catalog Description
Overview of operating systems and operating system principles. Concurrency, process scheduling and dispatch, memory management, security and protection, virtual machines, device management, and file systems.
* Prerequisites of the course
CSCI 3710 (Introduction to Digital Design and Computer Organization), CSCI 3320 (Data Structures), and MATH 1950 (Calculus I). CSCI 4350 (Computer Architecture) is recommended.
* Overview of content and purpose of the course:
An operating system is an abstraction of computer system hardware; it manages the sharing of various hardware and software resources among the users of the computer system. The parallel history of hardware and operating system development introduces many key concepts including, for example, processor modes, direct memory access (DMA), device controllers, and virtual memory. Basic approaches to kernel organization and implementation are considered. This is often the first course in which students encounter concurrency and concurrent programs. Additional topic areas include system performance evaluation (particularly relating to processor and memory management), security, virtualization, resource allocation and scheduling, and  file systems.
* Unusual circumstances of the course: None
