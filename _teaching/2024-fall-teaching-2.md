Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing due to breakthroughs in data accessibility, computing power, and algorithmic sophistication. This has contributed to a surge in AI applications across various domains, including search, machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. This course provides a foundational understanding of AI, exploring core concepts in problem-solving, heuristic search, knowledge representation, deduction, planning, and learning. Through hands-on programming assignments, students will develop autonomous agents capable of making informed decisions in complex environments. Upon course completion, students will be able to develop intelligent systems capable of autonomous decision-making and learning in fully informed, partially observable and adversarial settings. They will also master constraint programming techniques to address complex optimization challenges. This coursework provides a strong foundation for pursuing advanced AI research and practical applications. The main learning objectives of the course are to identify problems suitable for artificial intelligence techniques, and apply basic AI techniques and evaluate the suitability of more advanced methods, and contribute to the design of systems that exhibit intelligent behavior and learn from experience.

  ## Recommended Textbook
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Ed) by Russel and Norvig, Prentice Hall, 2021.

## Grading
If you have questions regarding the grading of homework, programming assignments, midterms and final, you MUST come to see the instructor WITHIN ONE WEEK after the date your homework, programming assignments, or exams have been returned to you.

## Late Policy
Homeworks and Programming Assignments are subject to late penalty. Here is the point deduction policy: <span style="color:red"> **20% deduction (late by 1 day), 40% deduction (late by 2 days), 80% deduction (late by 3 days), and no credit if late by more than three days.** </span>

Contact the instructor in case of a medical emergency, and a written proof from your doctor is required. <span style="color:red"> **You are allowed to extend one more day after the approval.** </span>

## Academic Integrity
You may discuss the homeworks and assignments with anyone and use any reference materials, but provided you do not copy any other person's work. We will follow [the University Policy](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php) on Academic Integrity regarding any cheating and plagiarism. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the contents of this page, as you are responsible for its contents.
